Adjacency Matrix Visualizer using Pygame
This project is a Python program that visualizes a graph based on the adjacency matrix provided by the user. It utilizes the Pygame library for creating the graphical interface.

Features:
Allows users to input an adjacency matrix representing a graph.
Visualizes the graph dynamically in a Pygame window.
Displays vertices with numbers for easy identification.
Draws edges between vertices based on the adjacency matrix.

Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the Pygame library using pip:
pip install pygame

Usage
Run the graphs.py script.
Enter the number of vertices and the elements of the adjacency matrix when prompted.
Watch as the graph is visualized in the Pygame window.

Example
Here's an example of how to input an adjacency matrix for a graph with 3 vertices:

Enter the number of vertices( or number of rows of the matrix): 3

Enter the elements of the matrix separated by space and each row on the next line:

0 1 0
0 1 0
1 0 1

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pygame
